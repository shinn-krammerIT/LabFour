What have I learnt?
This week I learnt how to implement functions in javascript. I learnt about the main attributes of functions and the clean formetting of them.

Why have I learnt this?
I have learnt this to use functions when coding with Javascript. Functions are the most useful way of of calling code that would be very repetitive. Functions make code easier to navigate ass well. 

How have I learnt this?
I've learnt this through creating multiple JS files within git repositories  and developing  a number of Functions then executing them through VS's terminal shell and examining the results. We have done this practical as an assignment and as a practical lab. The assignment involved solving 4 issues by creating functions with a buddy. And the lab asked us to use a function to convert a regular integer to binary. 

What is the point?
Functions are good.

What will I do to remember this learning?
Continue practicing and using JavaScript. I am really enjoying the Free code camp website at the moment. It's really easy to read and understand.


What are the real life/work applications?
use of Javascript in the IT industry. 

What will I do to fill in anygaps in my understanding?
I will keep a list of resources such as MDN, Free Code Camp, Code Combat and more. MDN can for when I am stuck on specific commands and functions and interactive sites like FCC and Code Combat will keep me up to practice.
